# 👀 Interactive Eye Tracker

The **Interactive Eye Tracker** is a model that simulates **human eye movement**.  
The eyes move in response to the **visitor’s face direction**, creating a realistic effect that makes the eyes appear to follow the user in real-time.

This project blends **computer vision**, **facial feature detection**, and **servo motor control** to deliver an engaging interactive experience.

## 💡 Project Overview
- Tracks the visitor's face and gaze direction using **computer vision algorithms**.  
- Converts the detected movement into **horizontal and vertical commands** for the eye model.  
- Provides a **realistic simulation of human eye movement**, enhancing interactive and educational displays.

## ⚙️ Components and Parts Used
- 🧠 **Arduino Uno** – controls servo motors  
- 🔄 **Two Servo Motors** – move the eyes horizontally and vertically  
- 👁️ **Eye Model** – provides realistic movement
